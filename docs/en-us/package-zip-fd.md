# About ZIP-fd Version

A framework-dependent version of the portable package.  
The size of the distribution package is small, but `.NET Desktop Runtime - Windows x64` must be installed. 
If you use the Susie plug-in, you will also need to install `.NET Desktop Runtime - Windows x86`.

* No installation is required, just extract the Zip and run NeeView.exe.    
* A dialog may appear at startup prompting you to install .NET Desktop Runtime. Follow the message to download and install the software.
* Configuration files and other user data are stored in the `Profile` folder.  
* Uninstallation is simply a matter of deleting the file.

> [!NOTE]  
> Explorer-related settings use the registry. These settings do not disappear even if the application is deleted, so please turn them off in the settings before deleting.
