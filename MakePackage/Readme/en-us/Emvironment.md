## How to install / uninstall

### Zip version

  * NeeView<VERSION/>-x64/x86.zip

  Usually use the x64 version. Use the x86 version only if your OS is 32-bit.
  
  Installation is unnecessary. After unpacking the zip, just run `NeeView.exe`.
  User data such as setting files etc. are also saved in the same place.  

  Uninstallation basically only removes files. 
  Please note only if you registered in the Explorer context menu in the settings. This feature uses the registry, and can be removed from the registry by turning it off in settings.

### Installer version

  * NeeView<VERSION/>-x64/x86.msi

  Usually use the x64 version. Use the x86 version only if your OS is 32-bit.

  Installation starts when you run it. Follow the instructions of the installer.  
  Configuration files etc. User data is saved in the application data folder of each user.  
  You can check this folder by "Option" > "Open setting folder" in NeeView menu.  
  
  For uninstallation, use "Apps and Features" of OS.  
  However, user data such as setting data does not disappear by just uninstalling.
  Please manually erase or execute "Delete data" (installed version only function) of NeeView setting before uninstallation.
